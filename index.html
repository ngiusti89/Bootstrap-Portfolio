          <p>Hi! My name's Natasha. I'm 29, born in Vermont, raised in Connecticut, and resident of California for ten years now. In school I studied mostly sociology, but somehow fell into a 'tech' job. I started doing content entry and management, which was mostly copy & paste for days on end. Eventually that led to some HTML work, which lead to me teaching myself more about that and then CSS, and now here I am.</p>
          
          <p>What's funniest to me is how impressed others are that I am studying this. It sounds impressive, but when you break it down, it is just the basics of a new language. Technically, anyone can do it. Just takes a whole lot of patience.</p>
